# Image Repository

<br/>

This repository provides a simple solution for saving images uploaded through [Typora](https://typora.io/), a popular markdown editor. This is also primarily used when writing a post with some images on my [blog](http://glanceyes.tistory.com). When I add an image on markdown file, it is automatically uploaded to this repository by [up2b](https://github.com/thep0y/up2b), one of the Typora uploader written by Python.

<br/>

## Overview

By default, Typora saves uploaded images to a temporary folder. This can be inconvenient if you want to keep your images for future use or to share them with others. This repository provides a simple solution for saving uploaded images to a specific folder in your repository.

<br/>

## Usage

To use this image saver, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
bashCopy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/typora-image-saver.git
```

1. In Typora, go to Preferences â†’ Image, and then select the option "Copy Image to Custom Folder" under the "Upload" section.
2. Set the folder path to the `images` directory in the cloned repository.
3. Now, when you upload an image in Typora, it will be saved to the `images` directory in your cloned repository.
4. To use the saved image in your markdown file, use the relative path to the `images` folder.

## Example

Suppose you have a markdown file named `example.md` in your cloned repository, and you want to insert an image named `image.png` that you uploaded in Typora.

Here's how you can do it:

```
scssCopy code
![Image description](./images/image.png)
```

This will insert the image into your markdown file, and it will be displayed when you view it in Typora or on GitHub.

This project was inspired by the need to save images uploaded in Typora to a specific folder for future use or sharing.
